Made By GJWHF GROUP.   BEAST v4.0

1)Simplified distance-control.

2)Our rotation string fixed(Thanks to WeekendObsession)

3)Replaced the gun with Username: WeekendObsession's we are not using Username: FunkyChicken's guns anymore. Managed to add distance-control and setAdjustGun.

4)On that version we turned back to orginal random movement, kept setAdjust but left out the distance-control. We also change to consuming energy managment added.

5)Stop and Go death limit now is 2, before it was 3. 

Commented code and ready to use.
